# Python And Selenium

I would to like to share, what I did and will do during **Python With Selenium** camp.

Firstly, I'm going to show *data type* and explain as best I can. You can reach the page from the link below;

</br>

This time, I've worked on **Conditional Statments** and **Loops**. Also, I tried to use ***args** and some methods of **list()**. You can reach it from the link below;

</br>

I would like to explain **Inheritence** keyword with the basic example. I created a class that called by *Math*. There are four type function with **init** function. Actually, I tried to show structure of class in Python. It's a little bit different from other **OOP** Language. You can reach out from the link below;
