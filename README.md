# Python And Selenium

## Python

### I would to like to share, what I did and will do during **Python With Selenium** camp

Firstly, I'm going to show *data type* and explain as best I can. You can reach the page from the link below;
</br>

- [Data_Type](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/dataType.py)
</br>

This time, I've worked on **Conditional Statments** and **Loops**. Also, I tried to use ***args** and some methods of **list()**. You can reach it from the link below;
</br>

- [Student_Managment_Sytem](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/studentManagmentSystem.py)
</br>

I would like to explain **Inheritence** keyword with the basic example. I created a class that called by *Math*. There are four type function with **init** function. Actually, I tried to show structure of class in Python. It's a little bit different from other **OOP** Language. You can reach out from the link below;

</br>

## SELENIUM

Let's continue with Selenium. Firstly, I've made up some basic example. For example, entry [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Kodlama.io](https://www.kodlama.io). Also, I'm trying to use selenium to test on [Sauce](https://www.saucedemo.com). You can reach the details below both of their link;
</br>

</br>

- [TestSauce](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/Selenium/testSauce.py)
</br>

Now, I would like to mention the some important point regarding *HTML*,*HTML Locators*,*Selenium Actions*. I explained all of them shortly. You can reach out below link;
</br>

- [ImportantPoints](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/Selenium/ImportantPoint.md)
</br>

I've updated the [TestSauce](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/Selenium/testSauce.py) file. I've added more examples, I tested almost thee whole scenarios of the login system. You can reach the details from the below link;
</br>

- [TestSauce](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/Selenium/testSauce.py)
</br>

This time, I've created the **pytest** with the [TestSauce](https://github.com/alperengokbak/PythonWithSelenium/blob/main/Selenium/testSauce.py)'s functions. In this way, I created real test case with selenium.

</br>

I would like to share shortly pasage regarding **Pytest Decorators**. I'm trying to explain more clearily with the examples. You can reach defined page in the below link;
