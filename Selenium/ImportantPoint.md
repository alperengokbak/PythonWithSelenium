# HTML, HTML Locators, Selenium Actions

## HTML(HyperText Markup Language)

It's the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior. Usually, we use the *Frontend side*.

## HTML Locators

Locators are the way to identify an HTML element on a web page, and almost all UI automation tools provide the capability to use locators for the identification of HTML elements on a web page. We can give example for the locators;

- ID
- Name
- ClassName
- TagName
- LinkText
- CssSelector
- XPath
